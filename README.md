# Object-detection-and-Speech
Object detection using tensorflow SSD_Mobilenet CNN and speech
## Summary
This repository is a application of tensorflow object detection api to detect objects in webcam feed and 
it gives audible output for the detected object's class name. For audio output is uses google text to speech 
to get audio files for class names and pygame to play the audio.

## Introduction
The repository is written for Windows 10, and it will also work for Windows 7 and 8. The general procedure can also 
be used for Linux operating systems, but file paths and package installation commands will need to change accordingly.

## Steps
### 1. Install TensorFlow-GPU 1.5 (skip this step if TensorFlow-GPU 1.5 is already installed)
Install TensorFlow-GPU by following the instructions in [this YouTube Video by Mark Jay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RplXYjxgZbw).

The video is made for TensorFlow-GPU v1.4, but the “pip install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu” command will automatically download version 1.5. Download and install CUDA v9.0 and cuDNN v7.0 (rather than CUDA v8.0 and cuDNN v6.0 as instructed in the video), because they are supported by TensorFlow-GPU v1.5. As future versions of TensorFlow are released, you will likely need to continue updating the CUDA and cuDNN versions to the latest supported version.

Be sure to install Anaconda with Python 3.6 as instructed in the video, as the Anaconda virtual environment will be used for the rest of this tutorial.

Visit [TensorFlow's website](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_windows) for further installation details, including how to install it on other operating systems (like Linux). The [object detection repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) itself also has [installation instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).

### 2. Set up TensorFlow Directory and Anaconda Virtual Environment
The TensorFlow Object Detection API requires using the specific directory structure provided in its GitHub repository. It also requires several additional Python packages, specific additions to the PATH and PYTHONPATH variables, and a few extra setup commands to get everything set up to run or train an object detection model. 

#### 2a. Set up new Anaconda virtual environment
Next, we'll work on setting up a virtual environment in Anaconda for tensorflow-gpu. From the Start menu in Windows, search for the Anaconda Prompt utility, right click on it, and click “Run as Administrator”. If Windows asks you if you would like to allow it to make changes to your computer, click Yes.

In the command terminal that pops up, create a new virtual environment called “tensorflow1” by issuing the following command:
```
C:\> conda create -n tensorflow1 pip python=3.5
```
Then, activate the environment by issuing:
```
C:\> activate tensorflow1
```
Install tensorflow-gpu in this environment by issuing:
```
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```
Install the other necessary packages by issuing the following commands:
```
(tensorflow1) C:\> conda install -c anaconda protobuf
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install pillow
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install lxml
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install Cython
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install jupyter
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install matplotlib
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install pandas
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install opencv-python
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install gtts
(tensorflow1) C:\> pip install pygame
```


#### 2b. Download TensorFlow Object Detection API repository from GitHub
Create a folder directly in C: and name it “tensorflow1”. This working directory will contain the full TensorFlow object detection framework, as well as your training images, training data, trained classifier, configuration files, and everything else needed for the object detection classifier.

Download the full TensorFlow object detection repository located at https://github.com/tensorflow/models by clicking the “Clone or Download” button and downloading the zip file. Open the downloaded zip file and extract the “models-master” folder directly into the C:\anaconda\envs\tensorflow1 directory you just created. Rename “models-master” to just “models”.
(Note, this tutorial was done using this [GitHub commit](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/079d67d9a0b3407e8d074a200780f3835413ef99) of the TensorFlow Object Detection API. If portions of this tutorial do not work, it may be necessary to download and use this exact commit rather than the most up-to-date version.)


#### 2c. Download this tutorial's repository from GitHub
Download the full repository located on this page (scroll to the top and click Clone or Download) and extract all the contents directly into the C:\tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection directory. (You have to overwrite the existing "utils/visualization_utils.py" file because that file is modified for this project.) This establishes a specific directory structure that will be used for the rest of the tutorial. 


This repository contains the sounds for the class names in the MSCOCO dataset. It has scripts to test out the object detection classifier on a webcam feed.



#### 2d. Test TensorFlow setup to verify it works
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is now all set up to use pre-trained models for object detection, or to train a new one. You can test it out and verify your installation is working by launching the object_detection_tutorial.ipynb script with Jupyter. From the \object_detection directory, issue this command:
```
(tensorflow1) C:\tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection> jupyter notebook object_detection_tutorial.ipynb
```
This opens the script in your default web browser and allows you to step through the code one section at a time. You can step through each section by clicking the “Run” button in the upper toolbar. The section is done running when the “In [ * ]” text next to the section populates with a number (e.g. “In [1]”). 

(Note: part of the script downloads the ssd_mobilenet_v1 model from GitHub, which is about 74MB. This means it will take some time to complete the section, so be patient.)
